# DevelopVersion
Try the version from "Release" folder first.
In case of a crash, run the version from "Debug" folder and send me it's log output, so I can fix the error.
The "Debug" version is extremly slow (it will look like it freezes), but it generates a lot of usefull data (it doesn't contain any sensitive information, only your HW description and utility callstack).
